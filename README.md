# [Fomu Workshop](https://workshop.fomu.im/)

![Hi, I'm Fomu!](img/logo.png "Fomu logo")

Hi, I'm Fomu!  [This workshop](https://workshop.fomu.im/) covers the basics of
Fomu in a top-down approach.  We'll start out by learning what Fomu is, how to
load software into Fomu, and finally how to write software for Fomu.

FPGAs are complex, weird things, so we'll take a gentle approach and start out
by treating it like a Python interpreter first, and gradually peel away layers
until we're writing our own hardware registers.  You can take a break at any
time and explore!  Stop when you feel the concepts are too unfamiliar, or
plough on and dig deep into the world of hardware.
