Hi, I’m `Fomu <https://github.com/im-tomu/fomu-hardware>`_ (FPGA Tomu)!
This workshop covers the basics of Fomu in a top-down approach. We’ll
start out by learning **what Fomu is**, **how to load software** into Fomu,
**how to write software** for Fomu, and finally **how to write hardware** for Fomu.

FPGAs are complex, weird things, so we’ll take a gentle approach and
start out by treating it like a Python interpreter first, and gradually
peel away layers until we’re writing our own hardware registers. You can
take a break at any time and explore! Stop when you feel the concepts
are too unfamiliar, or plough on and dig deep into the world of
hardware.
