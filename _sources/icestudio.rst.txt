Fomu on IceStudio *Nightly*
---------------------------

.. IMPORTANT:: Fomu is currently not supported in the stable releases
  of IceStudio. Development or `nightly <https://github.com/juanmard/icestudio/releases/tag/nightly>`_
  releases need to be used.

“Hello world!” - Blink a LED
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The canonical “Hello, world!” of hardware is to blink a LED. The
directory ``icestudio`` contains a Blinky example in ICE format.
Moreover, ``Blinky_BoardTop.ice`` wraps Blinky, showcasing how
to use the Design Under Test (DUT) as a black box.

Open ``Blinky_BoardTop.ice`` from `Icestudio <https://juanmard.github.io/icestudio/>`_
and use the buttons at the botton:

   :align: center
   :target: https://github.com/juanmard/icestudio

0. Check that the **selected board** is the Fomu.

   - Click on the button with a 'microchip' icon, and a modal window will open.
   - There, select the device (UP5K) in the first dropdown list and the board (Fomu)
     in the second list.

1. Click on the **Verify** button for checking the design.
2. Click on the **Build** button for having the design exported to Verilog, synthesised,
   placed, routed and, finally, the bitstream generated.
3. Click on the **Upload** for sending the bitstream to the board.
4. After each of the steps is executed, the corresponding log can be shown through button
   **View command output**.

You should see the rainbow pattern in the Fomu as soon as the *Upload*
step is finished:

However, that's just the beginning of the trip...

Navigation
==========

You can navigate the hierarchy of the design by double-clicking on the main
block. Go as deep as you want, until you find raw Verilog code. As you
can observe, ICE modules are fancy wrappers around the Verilog code from
``verilog/blink``.

Editing submodules is blocked by default, but you can unlock the feature
with the red button at the botton left. Do the modifications you wish,
then save the changes and go back to the top. There is a 'Home' button
at the bottom left for jumping to the root of the design straightaway.
From the top, you can verify, build and upload the design again.

You can also open or save each of the blocks as an independent project.
For instance, open ``Blinky.ice``, instead of ``Blinky_BoardTop.ice``:

Modules are browsable, as shown in the screencast above:

Board rules
===========

A feature in *IceStudio Nightly* named "*board rules*" allows predefining
assignments for I/O pins. For instance, Fomu needs to disconnect its USB
communication stack when writting raw HDL. Therefore, it is always necessary
to define and set pins *usb_dn*, *usb_dp* and *usb_dp_pu*. Option
*board rules* does so, allowing a cleaner graphical desing.

Open ``Blinky_BoardTop_rules.ice``, which is the result of using this feature
in the Blinky example. As you see, USB pins need not to be defined explicitly:

Instead, ensure that option *board rules* is activate in the board properties:

As shown in the screencast, you can inpect the specific rules applied to each
pin by using the "*View board rules*" button in the board properties window.

The same rules can be applied to modules lower in the hierarchy. For example, open
``Blinky_rules.ice`` and compare with ``Blinky_rules.ice`` above:
