msgid "FPGAs are complex, weird things, so we’ll take a gentle approach and start out by treating it like a Python interpreter first, and gradually peel away layers until we’re writing our own hardware registers. You can take a break at any time and explore! Stop when you feel the concepts are too unfamiliar, or plough on and dig deep into the world of hardware."
