msgid "To install all the dependencies and prepare the environment for building the Zephyr application follow the official `Zephyr Getting Started Guide <https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/getting_started/index.html>`__ up to point 4. On Linux you can follow the instructions from the point 5 on installing the Software Development Toolchain. The python version in the FOMU toolchain may not work; remove it from your PATH before attempting to build zephyr. For other operating systems, if you followed the instructions from the ``Required Software`` section of this tutorial, you should have a toolchain in ``PATH``."
