msgid "LiteX used as the soft SoC on Fomu is a very robust and scalable soft SoC platform, capable of running both bare metal binaries, Zephyr and even Linux."
msgstr ""

#: ../../renode.rst:8
msgid "It is also supported in `Renode <https://renode.io>`__, which is an open source simulation framework that lets you run unmodified software in a fully controlled and inspectable environment. Renode is a functional simulator, which means it aims to mimic the observable behavior of the hardware instead of trying to be cycle-accurate."

#: ../../renode.rst:14
msgid "We will now see how a full-blown Zephyr RTOS can be run on LiteX in Renode, and then how this simulation can be interfaced with a Fomu for a useful HW/SW co-development workflow."
msgstr ""

#: ../../renode.rst:19
msgid "Apart from RISC-V and LiteX platforms, Renode supports many other architectures and platforms, as described in the `documentation <https://renode.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction/supported-boards.html>`__, which also includes a user manual and a few tutorials. You can also take a look at a `Video Tutorials section on Renode’s website <https://renode.io/tutorials/>`__."

msgid "Keep in mind that all platforms and configurations in Renode used in this tutorial are contained in text/config files - you can also explore Renode’s usage patterns by just inspecting those files for details."
