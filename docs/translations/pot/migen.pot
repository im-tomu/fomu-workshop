msgid "Migen is an HDL embedded in Python. The verilog examples (in directory ``verilog``) can also be written using Migen; an implementation is provided in directory ``migen``."

msgid "To try them out, go to the ``migen`` directory and execute ``blink.py`` or ``blink-expanded.py`` respectively (before, ensure that you have set the ``FOMU_REV`` environment variable correctly). This will create a ``build`` directory with a ``top.bin`` file."

msgid "LiteX provides us with a Wishbone abstraction layer. There really is no reason we need to include a CPU with our design, but we can still reuse the USB Wishbone bridge in order to write HDL code."
msgstr ""

#: ../../migen.rst:28
msgid "We can use ``DummyUsb`` to respond to USB requests and bridge USB to Wishbone, and rely on LiteX to generate registers and wire them to hardware signals. We can still use ``wishbone-tool`` to read and write memory, and with a wishbone bridge we can actually have code running on our local system that can read and write memory on Fomu."

msgid "Take a look at ``build/csr.csv``. This describes the various regions present in our design. You can see ``memory_region,sram,0x10000000,131072``, which indicates the RAM is 128 kilobytes long and is located at ``0x10000000``, just as when we had a CPU. You can also see the timer, which is a feature that comes as part of LiteX. Let’s try reading and writing RAM:"

msgid "Aside from that, there’s not much we can *do* with this design. But there’s a lot of infrastructure there. So let’s add something we can see (``workshop_rgb.py`` contains the completed example)."

#: ../../migen.rst:135
msgid "This is the RGB block from the datasheet. It has five inputs: ``CURREN``, ``RGBLEDEN``, ``RGB0PWM``, ``RGB1PWM``, and ``RGB2PWM``. It has three outputs: ``RGB0``, ``RGB1``, and ``RGB2``. It also has four parameters: ``CURRENT_MODE``, ``RGB0_CURRENT``, ``RGB1_CURRENT``, and ``RGB2_CURRENT``."

msgid "This block is defined in Verilog (as ``SB_RGBA_DRV``), but we can import it as a Module into Migen:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../migen.rst:164
msgid "This will instantiate this Verilog block and connect it up. It also creates a ``CSRStorage`` object that is three bits wide, and assigns it to ``output``. By having this derive from ``AutoCSR``, the CSRStorage will have CSR bus accessor methods added to it automatically. Finally, it wires the pads up to the outputs of the block."

msgid "We can instantiate this block by simply creating a new object and adding it to ``self.specials`` in our design:"

msgid "We can use ``wishbone-tool`` to write values to ``0x60003000`` (or whatever your ``build/csr.csv`` says) and see them take effect immediately."
msgstr ""

#: ../../migen.rst:207
msgid "You can see that it takes very little code to take a Signal from HDL and expose it on the Wishbone bus."
