Hi, I’m Fomu! This workshop covers the basics of Fomu in a top-down
approach. We’ll start out by learning what Fomu is, how to load software
into Fomu, and finally how to write software for Fomu.

FPGAs are complex, weird things, so we’ll take a gentle approach and
start out by treating it like a Python interpreter first, and gradually
peel away layers until we’re writing our own hardware registers. You can
take a break at any time and explore! Stop when you feel the concepts
are too unfamiliar, or plough on and dig deep into the world of
hardware.
