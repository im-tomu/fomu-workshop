Migen and LiteX
---------------

.. _hello-world---blink-an-led-1:

“Hello world!” - Blink a LED
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Migen is an HDL embedded in Python. The verilog examples (in directory
``verilog``) can also be written using Migen; an implementation is provided
in directory ``migen``.

To try them out, go to the ``migen`` directory and execute ``blink.py`` or
``blink-expanded.py`` respectively (before, ensure that you have set
the ``FOMU_REV`` environment variable correctly). This will create a
``build`` directory with a ``top.bin`` file.

Using ``dfu-util -D build/top.bin``, it can be loaded onto the Fomu and should
work identically as the corresponding verilog example.

Wishbone Bus Basics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

LiteX provides us with a Wishbone abstraction layer. There really is no
reason we need to include a CPU with our design, but we can still reuse
the USB Wishbone bridge in order to write HDL code.

We can use ``DummyUsb`` to respond to USB requests and bridge USB to
Wishbone, and rely on LiteX to generate registers and wire them to
hardware signals. We can still use ``wishbone-tool`` to read and write
memory, and with a wishbone bridge we can actually have code running on
our local system that can read and write memory on Fomu.

Go to the ``litex`` directory and build the design;

If you get an error message about missing modules, check you have all
submodules cloned and setup with;

.. session:: shell-session

   $ git submodule update --recursive --init
   $

Take a look at ``build/csr.csv``. This describes the various regions
present in our design. You can see
``memory_region,sram,0x10000000,131072``, which indicates the RAM is 128
kilobytes long and is located at ``0x10000000``, just as when we had a
CPU. You can also see the timer, which is a feature that comes as part
of LiteX. Let’s try reading and writing RAM:

.. session:: shell-session

   $ wishbone-tool 0x10000000
   Value at 10000000: 0baf801e
   $ wishbone-tool 0x10000000 0x98765432
   $ wishbone-tool 0x10000000
   Value at 10000000: 98765432
   $

Wishbone Bus Extension
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Aside from that, there’s not much we can *do* with this design. But
there’s a lot of infrastructure there. So let’s add something we can see
(``workshop_rgb.py`` contains the completed example).

.. image:: _static/ice40-rgb.jpg
   :width: 100%
   :alt: RGB block

This is the RGB block from the datasheet. It has five inputs:
``CURREN``, ``RGBLEDEN``, ``RGB0PWM``, ``RGB1PWM``, and ``RGB2PWM``. It
has three outputs: ``RGB0``, ``RGB1``, and ``RGB2``. It also has four
parameters: ``CURRENT_MODE``, ``RGB0_CURRENT``, ``RGB1_CURRENT``, and
``RGB2_CURRENT``.

This block is defined in Verilog (as ``SB_RGBA_DRV``), but we can import it as
a Module into Migen:

.. code:: python

   class FomuRGB(Module, AutoCSR):
       def __init__(self, pads):
           self.output = CSRStorage(3)
           self.specials += Instance("SB_RGBA_DRV",
               i_CURREN = 0b1,
               i_RGBLEDEN = 0b1,
               i_RGB0PWM = self.output.storage[0],
               i_RGB1PWM = self.output.storage[1],
               i_RGB2PWM = self.output.storage[2],
               o_RGB0 = pads.r,
               o_RGB1 = pads.g,
               o_RGB2 = pads.b,
               p_CURRENT_MODE = "0b1",
               p_RGB0_CURRENT = "0b000011",
               p_RGB1_CURRENT = "0b000011",
               p_RGB2_CURRENT = "0b000011",
           )

This will instantiate this Verilog block and connect it up. It also
creates a ``CSRStorage`` object that is three bits wide, and assigns it
to ``output``. By having this derive from ``AutoCSR``, the CSRStorage
will have CSR bus accessor methods added to it automatically. Finally,
it wires the pads up to the outputs of the block.

We can instantiate this block by simply creating a new object and adding
it to ``self.specials`` in our design:

.. code:: python

   ...
       # Add the LED driver block
       led_pads = soc.platform.request("rgb_led")
       soc.submodules.fomu_rgb = FomuRGB(led_pads)

Finally, we need to add it to the ``csr_map``:

.. code:: python

   ...
       soc.add_csr("fomu_rgb")

Now, when we rebuild this design and check ``build/csr.csv`` we can see
our new register:

.. code:: csv

   csr_register,fomu_rgb_output,0x60003000,1,rw

We can use ``wishbone-tool`` to write values to ``0x60003000`` (or whatever
your ``build/csr.csv`` says) and see them take effect immediately.

.. session:: shell-session

   $ wishbone-tool 0x60003000 0x1 # make LED green
   $ wishbone-tool 0x60003000 0x2 # make LED red
   $ wishbone-tool 0x60003000 0x3 # make LED yellow   
   $ wishbone-tool 0x60003000 0x4 # make LED blue
   $ wishbone-tool 0x60003000 0x5 # make LED teal
   $ wishbone-tool 0x60003000 0x6 # make LED pink
   $ wishbone-tool 0x60003000 0x7 # make LED white

You can see that it takes very little code to take a Signal from HDL and
expose it on the Wishbone bus.

Tying Signals together
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

See ``workshop_rot13.py`` for another example, where two CSRs are connected
(one as an input, one as an output) in order to create a one-character ROT13
encoder/decoder.
